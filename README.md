Lambda-Actions is an open standard to define **portable, platform-agnostic SOAR playbooks** ‚Äî Lambda-Actions is to Security Actions what [Sigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma) is to Detections.

## Why Lambda-Actions Exists
Lambda-Actions aims to eliminate vendor lock-in and fragmentation across automation platforms like:
- SOAR Platforms (e.g. XSOAR, FortiSOAR, Phantom, Resilient)
- Automation Platforms (e.g. Logic Apps, Zapier)
- Custom-built orchestrators

The following diagram shows how Lambda-Actions standardizes playbooks and enables cross-platform SOAR integration:
